(15/02/2019) - Create the program

1. The program need linux command. Cygwin must be installed
- install Cygwin-setup-x86_64.exe (64-bit ver.)
or download: http://cygwin.com/install.html

2. Main program is ProcessPositioning.m

3. We have laboratory website, you can visit

Output
mode 1 = No atmospheric delay correction
mode 2 = Tropospheric delay correction
mode 3 = Ionospheric  delay correction
mode 4 = Tropospheric+Ionospheric delay correction

PS. From the example, plese un-compress RINEX file first (/RINEX)
